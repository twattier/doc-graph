# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for DocGraph, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

**N/A - Greenfield project** with specialized requirements for template-aware documentation processing and Mermaid visualization that don't align with standard fullstack starters. Custom architecture required to handle complex template detection, cross-template relationship mapping, and performance-optimized diagram generation.
