#### Target User Personas

**Primary Persona - Project Decision Makers**
Technical leaders (Project Managers, Product Managers, Technical Architects) who need to rapidly assess project development readiness through documentation completeness. They value efficiency, confidence in decisions, and clear visual communication of complex relationships. Key behaviors: scanning for completeness, identifying gaps, communicating status to stakeholders.

**Secondary Persona - Development Teams**
Developers, DevOps engineers, and QA professionals who need to understand project structure for implementation planning. They prioritize context preservation, quick navigation, and detailed technical information accessibility. Key behaviors: tracing dependencies, understanding workflows, onboarding to new projects.

#### Usability Goals

- **Immediate Comprehension**: Users understand project structure within 60 seconds of viewing visualizations
- **Confident Decision-Making**: 85% of users feel confident making go/no-go decisions after 15-minute exploration
- **Context Preservation**: Users maintain orientation across template zones without losing their analysis thread
- **Template Recognition**: Users instantly recognize different template types through visual differentiation
- **Export Efficiency**: Mermaid diagram exports generate in under 5 seconds with GitHub-ready formatting
- **Navigation Fluidity**: Cross-template navigation maintains mental model coherence across framework boundaries

#### Design Principles

1. **Template-First Clarity** - Every interface element immediately communicates which template context the user is exploring
2. **Progressive Visual Disclosure** - Start with high-level overviews, allow drilling into details without losing context
3. **Relationship-Centric Design** - Connections and dependencies are visually prominent and easy to follow
4. **Mermaid-Native Patterns** - All visualizations follow Mermaid conventions for immediate recognition and export fidelity
5. **Cross-Template Coherence** - Unified visual language maintains usability while clearly distinguishing template zones

- Touch targets: Minimum 44px touch targets, adequate spacing between interactive elements

**Content:**
- Alternative text: Descriptive alt text for all diagrams, structured data for screen readers
- Heading structure: Logical heading hierarchy (h1-h6), consistent structure across template zones
- Form labels: Clear labels for all form controls, error messages associated with inputs

### Testing Strategy
Automated testing with axe-core, manual testing with keyboard-only navigation, screen reader testing with NVDA/JAWS, color contrast validation, usability testing with users who have disabilities.

## Responsiveness Strategy

### Breakpoints
| Breakpoint | Min Width | Max Width | Target Devices |
|------------|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| Mobile | 320px | 767px | Smartphones, small tablets |
| Tablet | 768px | 1023px | Tablets, small laptops |
| Desktop | 1024px | 1439px | Laptops, desktop monitors |
| Wide | 1440px | - | Large monitors, ultrawide displays |

### Adaptation Patterns

**Layout Changes**: Mobile-first responsive design with progressive enhancement. Complex visualizations adapt through simplified views and progressive disclosure.

**Navigation Changes**: Collapsible sidebar on mobile, hamburger menu for template zone switching, breadcrumbs collapse to current location with expandable history.

**Content Priority**: Mobile focuses on single template visualization, desktop enables side-by-side template comparison, wide screens support multiple concurrent visualizations.

**Interaction Changes**: Touch-optimized controls on mobile, hover states for desktop, gesture support for visualization manipulation (pinch-to-zoom, pan).

## Animation & Micro-interactions

### Motion Principles
Purposeful motion that supports user comprehension of template relationships and state changes. Animations respect prefers-reduced-motion settings and provide clear feedback for user actions.

### Key Animations
- **Template Zone Transition**: Smooth sliding transition with color fade (400ms, ease-out)
- **Visualization Loading**: Progressive reveal with skeleton states (200ms stagger, ease-in)
- **Node Expansion**: Scale and opacity animation for tree branches (300ms, ease-out)
- **Cross-Template Link Hover**: Subtle glow and connection line animation (150ms, ease-in-out)
- **Export Generation**: Progress indicator with completion celebration (Variable duration, linear)
- **Error States**: Gentle shake animation for invalid inputs (250ms, ease-in-out)
- **Search Results**: Staggered fade-in for results list (100ms stagger, ease-out)

## Performance Considerations

### Performance Goals
- **Page Load**: Initial page render under 1.5 seconds on 3G connection
- **Visualization Render**: Mermaid diagram generation under 2 seconds for 1000+ files
- **Interaction Response**: UI interactions respond within 100ms
- **Animation FPS**: Maintain 60fps during transitions and interactions

### Design Strategies
Progressive loading with skeleton states, lazy loading for off-screen visualizations, image optimization for exported diagrams, code splitting for template-specific functionality, virtualization for large tree structures, caching strategy for frequently accessed diagrams.
