# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
DocGraph provides an intuitive, template-aware documentation exploration experience that transforms complex project structures into navigable visual representations. The interface prioritizes clarity and context preservation, enabling users to confidently assess project readiness through intelligent visualization patterns that match their mental models of framework relationships.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Template-First Navigation**: All interactions begin with template detection and template-appropriate visualization
- **Context-Preserving Exploration**: Users maintain awareness of their location across different template zones
- **Visual-to-Detail Drill-Down**: Start with high-level Mermaid diagrams, drill into specific documentation content
- **Export-Ready Visualizations**: Every view can be exported as standard Mermaid format for external use
- **Search-Guided Discovery**: Template-aware search results guide users to relevant content within visual context

## Core Screens and Views
- **Project Import Screen**: GitHub repository URL input with automatic template detection preview
- **Template Detection Dashboard**: Overview showing discovered templates and mapping configuration options
- **Multi-Template Project Explorer**: Unified view showing all template zones with navigation switching
- **Tree Visualization View**: Hierarchical relationships for Claude Code and BMAD-core structures
- **Pipeline Visualization View**: Sequential workflow progression for BMAD-METHOD processes
- **Cross-Template Relationship Map**: Connections and dependencies between different template areas
- **Mermaid Export Interface**: Diagram generation and export capabilities with GitHub integration options
- **Search Results Interface**: Template-aware search with visual context preservation

## Accessibility: WCAG AA
DocGraph will implement WCAG AA compliance including keyboard navigation for all visualizations, screen reader compatibility for diagram content, and high contrast mode support for visual elements.

## Branding
Clean, professional interface using shadcn/ui component library for consistency. Visual design emphasizes clarity and hierarchy with documentation-focused typography. Mermaid diagrams follow standard conventions for immediate recognition and GitHub compatibility.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Web-based application optimized for desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) with responsive design for various screen sizes. No mobile-specific optimization required for MVP.
