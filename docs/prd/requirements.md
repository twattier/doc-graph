# Requirements

## Functional Requirements

**FR1:** The system SHALL import public GitHub repositories through URL input and automatically discover documentation structure

**FR2:** The system SHALL parse and classify documentation using configurable template mapping rules for BMAD-METHOD and Claude Code frameworks

**FR3:** The system SHALL generate template-aware tree visualizations for hierarchical relationships (Claude Code agents→tasks, BMAD-core subdirectories)

**FR4:** The system SHALL generate template-aware pipeline visualizations for sequential workflow processes (BMAD design workflows with step outputs)

**FR5:** The system SHALL export all visualizations as standard Mermaid diagram format with GitHub compatibility

**FR6:** The system SHALL provide cross-template relationship mapping to detect and visualize connections between different template zones within single projects

**FR7:** The system SHALL offer project configuration interface allowing template mapping overrides and adjustments per project with validation

**FR8:** The system SHALL provide text search across all imported documentation with template-aware result categorization

**FR9:** The system SHALL successfully visualize the reference Magnet project structure demonstrating both BMAD-METHOD docs and Claude Code .bmad-core configuration

**FR10:** The system SHALL maintain read-only access to documentation without editing or management capabilities

**FR11:** The system SHALL detect BMAD-METHOD workflow progression (brainstorming→PRD→architecture→UX) and visualize as pipeline

**FR12:** The system SHALL identify Claude Code agent hierarchies and task relationships for tree visualization

**FR13:** The system SHALL provide seamless navigation between template zones while preserving user context

## Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR1:** Visualization rendering performance SHALL complete within 2 seconds for repositories containing up to 1000 documentation files

**NFR2:** Mermaid diagram generation SHALL complete within 5 seconds for complex project structures

**NFR3:** The system SHALL support modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) with JavaScript ES2020+ without IE compatibility

**NFR4:** The system SHALL maintain responsive design for desktop browser focus without mobile optimization requirements

**NFR5:** GitHub API integration SHALL use OAuth authentication with rate limiting considerations for repository access

**NFR6:** The system SHALL process public GitHub repositories only for MVP scope

**NFR7:** Template mapping rules SHALL remain sufficiently flexible without becoming overly complex for user configuration

**NFR8:** The system SHALL maintain 99% uptime during business hours for target user base

**NFR9:** Mermaid diagrams SHALL be exportable and compatible with GitHub's native rendering capabilities
