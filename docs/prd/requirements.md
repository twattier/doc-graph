# Requirements

## Functional Requirements

**FR1:** The system SHALL import public Git repositories through URL input using git clone and automatically discover documentation structure

**FR2:** The system SHALL parse and classify documentation using configurable template mapping rules for BMAD-METHOD and Claude Code frameworks

**FR3:** The system SHALL generate template-aware tree visualizations for hierarchical relationships (Claude Code agents→tasks, BMAD-core subdirectories)

**FR4:** The system SHALL generate template-aware pipeline visualizations for sequential workflow processes (BMAD design workflows with step outputs)

**FR5:** The system SHALL export all visualizations as standard Mermaid diagram format with GitHub compatibility

**FR6:** The system SHALL provide cross-template relationship mapping to detect and visualize connections between different template zones within single projects

**FR7:** The system SHALL offer project configuration interface allowing template mapping overrides and adjustments per project with validation

**FR8:** The system SHALL provide text search across all imported documentation with template-aware result categorization

**FR9:** The system SHALL successfully visualize the reference Magnet project structure demonstrating both BMAD-METHOD docs and Claude Code .bmad-core configuration

**FR10:** The system SHALL maintain read-only access to documentation without editing or management capabilities

**FR11:** The system SHALL detect BMAD-METHOD workflow progression (brainstorming→PRD→architecture→UX) and visualize as pipeline

**FR12:** The system SHALL identify Claude Code agent hierarchies and task relationships for tree visualization

**FR13:** The system SHALL provide seamless navigation between template zones while preserving user context

**FR14:** The system SHALL provide documentation version history tracking based on GitHub commit changes to support review processes

**FR15:** The system SHALL enable review process validation where users can approve progression to next development steps (e.g., start epic development) or request changes to current step

**FR16:** The system SHALL support branch-based validation workflows where DocGraph validates merge decisions for development branches to main branch

**FR17:** The system SHALL provide markdown organization features including table of contents generation from heading trees and inter-document link detection

**FR18:** The system SHALL detect and visualize index files (e.g., prod/index.md) as central navigation hubs within documentation sections

**FR19:** The system SHALL support project sharing among multiple users with role-based access control (owner, editor, viewer)

## Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR1:** Visualization rendering performance SHALL complete within 2 seconds for repositories containing up to 1000 documentation files

**NFR2:** Mermaid diagram generation SHALL complete within 5 seconds for complex project structures

**NFR3:** The system SHALL support modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) with JavaScript ES2020+ without IE compatibility

**NFR4:** The system SHALL maintain responsive design for desktop browser focus without mobile optimization requirements

**NFR5:** The system SHALL support basic email-based user authentication without external OAuth dependencies

**NFR6:** The system SHALL process public Git repositories using direct git clone operations without API authentication

**NFR7:** Template mapping rules SHALL remain sufficiently flexible without becoming overly complex for user configuration

**NFR8:** The system SHALL maintain 99% uptime during business hours for target user base

**NFR9:** Mermaid diagrams SHALL be exportable and compatible with GitHub's native rendering capabilities

**NFR10:** The system SHALL run as a Docker-based application with local data persistence using mapped volumes

**NFR11:** Data storage SHALL use PostgreSQL with pgvector for documents and embeddings, Neo4j for graph relationships, and Redis for caching
