# DocGraph Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
• Enable teams to confidently assess project development readiness through template-aware documentation visualization
• Reduce time to project comprehension by 60% for new team members through intelligent navigation
• Provide template-specific visual patterns (trees for hierarchies, pipelines for workflows) that match user mental models
• Achieve 85% user confidence in development go/no-go decisions through clear relationship mapping
• Drive 25% increase in systematic methodology adoption by making framework documentation accessible
• Deliver successful visualization of 95% of BMAD-METHOD and Claude Code projects
• Export all visualizations as standardized Mermaid diagrams with GitHub integration capabilities

### Background Context

Development teams increasingly adopt systematic methodologies like BMAD-METHOD and Claude Code, but existing documentation tools treat all content generically, missing the template-specific relationships that make frameworks valuable. Teams struggle with fragmented documentation across repositories, losing critical context when navigating between sharded documents like PRDs, architecture specs, and agent configurations. This creates decision paralysis where teams cannot confidently determine if documentation is complete enough for development, leading to production quality risks and strategic misalignment. DocGraph addresses this gap by providing template-intelligent discovery and visualization with Mermaid-first approach, enabling teams to instantly assess project readiness and understand complex documentation structures through framework-aware visual patterns.
