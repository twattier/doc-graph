# Story 1.2 - Git Repository Import System

## Status
Completed ✅

## Story
**As a** project decision maker,
**I want** to import public Git repositories through a simple URL input,
**so that** I can access all project documentation for template-aware analysis

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Web interface accepts public Git repository URLs with validation (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
2. Git clone operations implemented for repository access without authentication
3. Repository content cloned and stored locally with proper error handling
4. File structure preserved maintaining original directory relationships
5. Import progress indicators show real-time status to users
6. Successful import of `./projects/magnet` repository structure verified
7. Local caching and update mechanisms implemented for repository synchronization
8. Basic email-based user management integrated for project ownership

## Dev Notes

### Implementation Progress (Story 1.2)
**Major Components Implemented:**
- ✅ **Complete Frontend Repository Import System**: React components with URL validation, progress tracking, and repository management
- ✅ **Complete Backend Git Service**: Async Git operations with GitPython, repository cloning, file analysis, and error handling
- ✅ **Database Models & API Routes**: PostgreSQL models for repositories and import jobs, FastAPI endpoints with background processing
- ✅ **Docker Configuration Updates**: Environment variable support, port configuration, and Git support in containers
- ✅ **Development Workflow**: Branching strategy, validation scripts, and automation tools

**Current Implementation Status:**
- **Frontend**: Repository import form, progress tracking UI, repository list management
- **Backend**: Full Git operations service, async repository processing, database integration
- **Infrastructure**: Updated Docker configs, environment variable management, development workflow

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.1 (Project Infrastructure Setup) established the foundational development environment with Docker containerization, database services, and CI/CD pipeline. This provides the platform for implementing the Git repository import functionality.

### Project Structure
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
The repository import system will integrate with:
- `apps/web/src/pages/` - Import interface and project management UI
- `apps/api/src/routes/` - Git operations and repository management endpoints
- `apps/api/src/services/` - Git clone and repository processing services
- Database tables for repository metadata and user management

### Technology Stack
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Frontend**: React components with shadcn/ui for import forms
- **Backend**: FastAPI endpoints for Git operations
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for repository metadata and user data
- **File System**: Local storage with Docker volume mapping
- **Git Operations**: GitPython or subprocess for clone operations

### API Design
Repository import endpoints:
- `POST /api/repositories/import` - Start repository import
- `GET /api/repositories/{id}/status` - Check import progress
- `GET /api/repositories` - List user repositories
- `PUT /api/repositories/{id}/sync` - Synchronize repository updates
- `DELETE /api/repositories/{id}` - Remove repository

### Security Considerations
- URL validation to prevent SSRF attacks
- Repository size limits to prevent disk space abuse
- Rate limiting for import operations
- User authentication and project isolation
- Sanitization of repository content before processing

### Performance Considerations
- Asynchronous import operations with progress tracking
- Repository caching to avoid duplicate downloads
- File system optimization for large repositories
- Background synchronization processes
- Import queue management for concurrent operations

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for Git operations and URL validation
- Integration tests for complete import workflow
- End-to-end tests with real repository imports
- Performance tests for large repository handling
- Security tests for malicious repository content
