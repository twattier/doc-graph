# Epic 2: Multi-Template Visualization System

**Epic Goal:** Implement the core visualization capabilities that transform detected template structures into navigable Mermaid diagrams, enabling users to instantly understand complex project relationships through template-specific visual patterns and export capabilities for GitHub integration.

## Story 2.1: Tree Visualization Engine
As a **development team member**,
I want **to see Claude Code agent and task hierarchies as navigable tree diagrams**,
so that **I can quickly understand the structure and relationships within the Magnet project's .bmad-core configuration**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Mermaid tree diagrams generated from Claude Code agent hierarchy detection
2. Agent-to-task relationships visualized with clear parent-child connections
3. Interactive navigation allowing expansion/collapse of tree branches
4. Node selection reveals detailed information about agents, tasks, and relationships
5. Magnet project `.bmad-core` structure renders as comprehensible tree visualization
6. Tree diagram export functionality generates valid Mermaid syntax
7. Performance optimization ensures sub-2 second rendering for complex hierarchies

## Story 2.2: Pipeline Visualization Engine
As a **project decision maker**,
I want **to see BMAD-METHOD workflow progression as a pipeline diagram**,
so that **I can assess the completeness and flow of the Magnet project's design documentation**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Mermaid pipeline diagrams generated from BMAD-METHOD workflow detection
2. Sequential progression visualized (brainstorming→brief→PRD→architecture→UX) with status indicators
3. Document completion status reflected in pipeline node styling
4. Cross-document dependencies and references highlighted in pipeline flow
5. Magnet project workflow progression renders as clear, assessible pipeline
6. Pipeline diagram export generates GitHub-compatible Mermaid format
7. Missing or incomplete workflow stages clearly identified for user action

## Story 2.3: Cross-Template Relationship Mapping
As a **technical architect**,
I want **to see connections between BMAD-METHOD documentation and Claude Code configuration**,
so that **I can understand how the Magnet project's design decisions relate to implementation structure**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Cross-template relationship detection identifies connections between `/docs` and `.bmad-core`
2. Relationship visualization shows dependencies and influences between template zones
3. Unified view combines tree and pipeline elements with connecting relationships
4. Relationship strength and type indicated through visual styling (dependency, reference, implementation)
5. Magnet project cross-template relationships accurately detected and visualized
6. Combined visualization maintains clarity while showing template zone boundaries
7. Relationship export includes metadata for external analysis and documentation

## Story 2.4: Mermaid Export System
As a **project communicator**,
I want **to export all visualizations as standard Mermaid diagrams**,
so that **I can share and embed DocGraph insights in GitHub documentation and presentations**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. All visualization types exportable as valid Mermaid diagram syntax
2. Export options include raw Mermaid code and rendered image formats
3. Exported diagrams render correctly in GitHub markdown files
4. Export maintains interactive elements where supported by target platform
5. Magnet project visualizations successfully exported and verified in GitHub context
6. Batch export capabilities for complete project visualization sets
7. Export metadata includes generation timestamps and DocGraph version information

## Story 2.5: Visualization Performance Optimization
As a **user**,
I want **visualizations to render quickly regardless of project complexity**,
so that **I can efficiently explore large projects without waiting for slow diagram generation**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Visualization rendering completes within 2-second performance target for up to 1000 files
2. Mermaid diagram generation completes within 5-second target for complex structures
3. Progressive loading implemented for large project structures
4. Caching system reduces repeat rendering time for unchanged content
5. Performance monitoring tracks and reports rendering times for optimization
6. Magnet project visualizations consistently meet performance targets
7. Memory usage optimized to prevent browser performance degradation during extended use
