# Epic 4: Project Configuration & Optimization

**Epic Goal:** Provide advanced configuration capabilities, performance optimization, and production-ready features that enable DocGraph to scale effectively while maintaining flexibility for diverse project structures and user requirements.

## Story 4.1: Advanced Template Configuration
As a **template customizer**,
I want **to create and modify template detection rules for specialized project structures**,
so that **I can adapt DocGraph to handle unique documentation patterns beyond standard BMAD-METHOD and Claude Code formats**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Template rule editor provides intuitive interface for creating custom pattern matching
2. Rule validation system prevents conflicting or invalid template configurations
3. Template library enables sharing and importing community-developed templates
4. Version control for template configurations with rollback capabilities
5. Custom template testing validates against sample projects before deployment
6. Template performance optimization ensures custom rules don't degrade system speed
7. Documentation and examples guide users in effective template customization

## Story 4.2: Performance Monitoring & Analytics
As a **system administrator**,
I want **comprehensive monitoring of DocGraph performance and usage patterns**,
so that **I can optimize system performance and understand user behavior for continuous improvement**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Performance dashboard tracks rendering times, memory usage, and system responsiveness
2. Usage analytics identify popular features and common user workflows
3. Error monitoring and alerting system enables proactive issue resolution
4. Performance optimization recommendations generated based on usage patterns
5. Capacity planning insights support scaling decisions and resource allocation
6. User behavior analysis informs feature prioritization and interface improvements
7. Performance reports exportable for stakeholder communication and planning

## Story 4.3: Enterprise Integration Preparation
As a **platform architect**,
I want **DocGraph architecture prepared for enterprise scaling and integration requirements**,
so that **the system can evolve beyond MVP limitations while maintaining core functionality**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Authentication system designed for enterprise SSO integration readiness
2. API endpoints documented and versioned for external integration capabilities
3. Data export formats support enterprise toolchain integration requirements
4. Security audit preparation with comprehensive access logging and controls
5. Scalability testing validates performance under enterprise usage patterns
6. Configuration management supports multi-tenant deployment scenarios
7. Enterprise feature roadmap documented with clear implementation priorities

## Story 4.4: Production Deployment & Maintenance
As a **DevOps engineer**,
I want **production-ready deployment and maintenance capabilities**,
so that **DocGraph operates reliably in production environments with proper monitoring and update procedures**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Production deployment pipeline automated with rollback capabilities
2. Database backup and recovery procedures tested and documented
3. System health monitoring with alerting for critical issues
4. Update deployment strategy minimizes downtime and user disruption
5. Load balancing and failover capabilities ensure high availability
6. Security hardening implemented following production best practices
7. Maintenance runbooks provide clear procedures for common operational tasks
