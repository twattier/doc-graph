# Epic 3: Cross-Template Navigation & Search

**Epic Goal:** Enable seamless exploration and discovery across different template zones while maintaining context and providing intelligent search capabilities that understand template-specific content and relationships.

## Story 3.1: Template-Aware Navigation System
As a **project explorer**,
I want **to navigate seamlessly between BMAD-METHOD docs and Claude Code configuration**,
so that **I can maintain context while exploring different aspects of the Magnet project structure**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Navigation interface provides clear indication of current template zone and available destinations
2. Context breadcrumbs maintain user orientation across template transitions
3. Cross-template links automatically detected and made clickable for seamless traversal
4. Navigation history preserved across template zones for easy backtracking
5. Magnet project navigation tested across all template zone combinations
6. Visual indicators distinguish template zones while maintaining unified interface experience
7. Keyboard shortcuts enable efficient navigation for power users

## Story 3.2: Template-Aware Search Engine
As a **information seeker**,
I want **to search across all project documentation with template-aware result organization**,
so that **I can quickly find relevant information while understanding its template context within the Magnet project**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Search index includes all imported documentation with template classification metadata
2. Search results organized by template zone with clear categorization
3. Search highlighting preserves template-specific formatting and context
4. Advanced search filters enable template-specific queries and refinement
5. Magnet project search functionality validates across diverse content types
6. Search performance maintains sub-second response times for typical queries
7. Search suggestions and auto-completion guide users to relevant template-aware content

## Story 3.3: Context Preservation System
As a **documentation reviewer**,
I want **to maintain awareness of my exploration path and current location**,
so that **I don't lose track of my analysis progress while navigating the complex Magnet project structure**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Persistent context panel shows current location within overall project structure
2. Visual indicators maintain template zone awareness during exploration
3. Recently viewed content accessible through context-aware history
4. Bookmark system enables saving and returning to specific locations with full context
5. Context preservation tested across extended Magnet project exploration sessions
6. Multi-tab support maintains separate context for parallel exploration paths
7. Context export enables sharing specific exploration states with team members

## Story 3.4: Advanced Relationship Discovery
As a **project analyst**,
I want **to discover previously unknown relationships between documentation components**,
so that **I can uncover insights about the Magnet project's design coherence and potential gaps**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Relationship analysis engine detects implicit connections beyond explicit references
2. Relationship strength scoring helps prioritize important connections for user attention
3. Interactive relationship exploration enables following connection paths across templates
4. Relationship anomaly detection identifies potential inconsistencies or missing links
5. Magnet project relationship discovery validates against known project structure
6. Relationship insights exportable for further analysis and documentation
7. Machine learning capabilities improve relationship detection accuracy over time
