# Project Brief: DocGraph

## Executive Summary

DocGraph is a documentation exploration and visualization platform that transforms complex, multi-template project documentation into navigable, template-aware visual experiences. The platform addresses the critical problem of navigating fragmented documentation across different methodologies (BMAD-METHOD, Claude Code) by providing template-specific visualization patterns and intelligent discovery systems. DocGraph serves project managers, architects, developers, and administrators who need to confidently assess project readiness and make informed development decisions based on framework documentation quality.

## Problem Statement

### Current State and Pain Points
Development teams struggle with fragmented documentation scattered across repositories, with different methodologies (BMAD-METHOD, Claude Code) requiring distinct mental models for navigation. Teams lose critical context when jumping between sharded documents (PRDs, architecture specs, agent configurations), leading to:

- **Decision Paralysis**: Unable to confidently determine if documentation is complete enough for development
- **Context Loss**: Missing relationships between agents, tasks, templates, and workflow outputs
- **Navigation Inefficiency**: No template-aware visualization makes complex documentation structures opaque
- **Knowledge Silos**: Documentation expertise trapped in specific methodology frameworks

### Impact of the Problem
- **Production Quality Risk**: Poor framework documentation directly correlates with technical debt and project failures
- **Development Delays**: Teams waste time reconstructing relationships between documentation components
- **Onboarding Friction**: New team members cannot quickly comprehend project structure and status
- **Strategic Misalignment**: Leadership lacks visibility into project readiness based on documentation completeness

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short
Current solutions treat all documentation generically, missing the template-specific relationships that make frameworks valuable. GitHub's file explorer shows structure but not semantic relationships. Documentation sites render content but don't reveal entity connections or workflow progressions. Generic visualization tools lack framework-specific intelligence.

### Urgency and Importance
As development teams increasingly adopt systematic approaches like BMAD-METHOD and Claude Code, the gap between methodology sophistication and visualization tooling becomes a critical bottleneck. Teams need immediate capability to assess and navigate their framework-driven documentation.

## Proposed Solution

### Core Concept and Approach
DocGraph provides template-aware documentation discovery, visualization, and querying through a multi-template architecture. The platform applies intelligent mapping rules to imported documentation, automatically classifying content based on framework patterns and presenting template-specific visualizations:

- **Tree relationships** for hierarchical structures (Claude Code commands→agents→tasks, BMAD-core subdirectories)
- **Pipeline workflows** for sequential processes (BMAD design workflows with step outputs)
- **Mermaid diagram generation** for standardized visualization format, matching GitHub's native support with enhanced template-aware intelligence
- **Cross-template relationship mapping** for projects using multiple methodologies

### Key Differentiators
- **Template-Intelligent Discovery**: Unlike generic documentation tools, DocGraph understands framework-specific patterns and relationships
- **Multi-Template Support**: Single projects can simultaneously use BMAD-METHOD, Claude Code, and custom templates with unified visualization
- **Mermaid-First Visualization**: Native Mermaid diagram generation provides standardized, shareable visualization format with GitHub integration capabilities
- **Configuration Flexibility**: Template defaults with project-specific override capabilities
- **Read-Only Focus**: Optimized for exploration and assessment rather than document management

### Why This Solution Will Succeed
DocGraph directly addresses the fundamental user need: navigating sharded documentation to make confident development decisions. By encoding template-specific intelligence and providing visual relationship mapping, teams can instantly assess project readiness and understand complex documentation structures.

### High-Level Vision
DocGraph becomes the standard interface for exploring framework-driven project documentation, enabling teams to confidently assess development readiness and navigate complex documentation relationships with template-aware intelligence.
