# Introduction

This document defines the user experience goals, information architecture, user flows, and visual design specifications for DocGraph's user interface. It serves as the foundation for visual design and frontend development, ensuring a cohesive and user-centered experience focused on template-aware documentation exploration.

## Overall UX Goals & Principles

### Target User Personas

**Primary Persona - Project Decision Makers**
Technical leaders (Project Managers, Product Managers, Technical Architects) who need to rapidly assess project development readiness through documentation completeness. They value efficiency, confidence in decisions, and clear visual communication of complex relationships. Key behaviors: scanning for completeness, identifying gaps, communicating status to stakeholders.

**Secondary Persona - Development Teams**
Developers, DevOps engineers, and QA professionals who need to understand project structure for implementation planning. They prioritize context preservation, quick navigation, and detailed technical information accessibility. Key behaviors: tracing dependencies, understanding workflows, onboarding to new projects.

### Usability Goals

- **Immediate Comprehension**: Users understand project structure within 60 seconds of viewing visualizations
- **Confident Decision-Making**: 85% of users feel confident making go/no-go decisions after 15-minute exploration
- **Context Preservation**: Users maintain orientation across template zones without losing their analysis thread
- **Template Recognition**: Users instantly recognize different template types through visual differentiation
- **Export Efficiency**: Mermaid diagram exports generate in under 5 seconds with GitHub-ready formatting
- **Navigation Fluidity**: Cross-template navigation maintains mental model coherence across framework boundaries

### Design Principles

1. **Template-First Clarity** - Every interface element immediately communicates which template context the user is exploring
2. **Progressive Visual Disclosure** - Start with high-level overviews, allow drilling into details without losing context
3. **Relationship-Centric Design** - Connections and dependencies are visually prominent and easy to follow
4. **Mermaid-Native Patterns** - All visualizations follow Mermaid conventions for immediate recognition and export fidelity
5. **Cross-Template Coherence** - Unified visual language maintains usability while clearly distinguishing template zones
