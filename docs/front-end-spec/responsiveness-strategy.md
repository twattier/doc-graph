## Breakpoints
| Breakpoint | Min Width | Max Width | Target Devices |
|------------|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| Mobile | 320px | 767px | Smartphones, small tablets |
| Tablet | 768px | 1023px | Tablets, small laptops |

## Adaptation Patterns

**Layout Changes**: Mobile-first responsive design with progressive enhancement. Complex visualizations adapt through simplified views and progressive disclosure.

**Navigation Changes**: Collapsible sidebar on mobile, hamburger menu for template zone switching, breadcrumbs collapse to current location with expandable history.

**Content Priority**: Mobile focuses on single template visualization, desktop enables side-by-side template comparison, wide screens support multiple concurrent visualizations.

**Interaction Changes**: Touch-optimized controls on mobile, hover states for desktop, gesture support for visualization manipulation (pinch-to-zoom, pan).
