# Performance Considerations

## Performance Goals
- **Page Load**: Initial page render under 1.5 seconds on 3G connection
- **Visualization Render**: Mermaid diagram generation under 2 seconds for 1000+ files
- **Interaction Response**: UI interactions respond within 100ms
- **Animation FPS**: Maintain 60fps during transitions and interactions

## Design Strategies
Progressive loading with skeleton states, lazy loading for off-screen visualizations, image optimization for exported diagrams, code splitting for template-specific functionality, virtualization for large tree structures, caching strategy for frequently accessed diagrams.
