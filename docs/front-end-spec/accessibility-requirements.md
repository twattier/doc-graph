## Key Requirements

**Visual:**
- Color contrast ratios: 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text, enhanced contrast mode available
- Focus indicators: High-contrast 2px outline with 2px offset, persistent during keyboard navigation
- Text sizing: Scalable up to 200% without horizontal scrolling, relative units throughout

**Interaction:**
- Keyboard navigation: Full keyboard access to all interactive elements, logical tab order, visual focus indicators

## Testing Strategy
Automated testing with axe-core, manual testing with keyboard-only navigation, screen reader testing with NVDA/JAWS, color contrast validation, usability testing with users who have disabilities.
