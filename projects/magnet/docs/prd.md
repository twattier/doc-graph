# Magnet Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Enable users to stay well-informed according to their specific centers of interest without information overload
- Reduce time spent finding relevant news by 40% through AI-powered synthesis and personalization
- Achieve 1,000+ weekly active users within 3 months with 70% reporting improved news consumption efficiency
- Establish sustainable freemium business model with 15% conversion rate to premium ($9.99/month)
- Create foundation for long-term AI-powered information consumption platform

### Background Context

RSS users currently face critical information overload that prevents effective news consumption. Despite having access to vast amounts of information through RSS feeds, users cannot efficiently process content to stay well-informed about topics that matter to them personally and professionally. Through user research, we identified that the core need is not more information, but the right information that's personally relevant, synthesized, and digestible.

Existing RSS readers focus on aggregation and basic filtering rather than intelligent synthesis and personalization. They treat all users the same and don't leverage AI to understand context, importance, or individual relevance patterns. Magnet addresses this gap by combining traditional RSS aggregation with generative AI to create an intelligent news consumption platform that learns user interests and synthesizes content accordingly.
